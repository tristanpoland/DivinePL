## Introduction

DivinePL is a programming language designed to bring divine inspiration to your code. It combines familiar programming concepts with spiritual metaphors to create a unique and memorable coding experience. The language focuses on clean, blessed code with proper structures and conventions.

DivinePL is interpreted by a divine interpreter that ensures your code adheres to righteous programming principles. The interpreter includes features like the Sabbath check (no compilation on Sundays), confessions (linting), miracles (optimizations), and judgment day (final validation).

## Installation

To install DivinePL:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/tristanpoland/DivinePL.git
```

2. Build the interpreter:
```
cd DivinePL
cargo build --release
```

3. Add the divine interpreter to your PATH:
```
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/DivinePL/target/release
```

## Basic Syntax

DivinePL draws inspiration from JavaScript but adds divine elements. Files use the `.divine` or `.dpl` extension.

```javascript
// DivinePL basic syntax example

// Import divine inspirations
import verse "wisdom";

// Prayer comments
üôè Lord, guide this function to optimal performance üôè

// Define a function with blessing
bless calculateDivinity(soul) {
  let divinity = soul.faith * soul.goodDeeds;
  
  // Covenants are like constants
  covenant MAX_DIVINITY = 100;
  
  if (divinity > MAX_DIVINITY) {
    divinity = MAX_DIVINITY;
  }
  
  // Revelation for logging
  revelation("Divinity calculated: " + divinity);
  
  return divinity;
}

// Program entry point
bless Program {
  genesis() {
    // Your main code here
    return salvation;
  }
}
```

## Core Features

### Blessings (Functions)

All functions in DivinePL must be blessed to receive divine optimization. The `bless` keyword precedes function declarations:

```javascript
bless calculateTithe(income) {
  return income * 0.1;
}
```

Functions without the `bless` keyword are considered sinful and will be flagged during confession (linting).

### Genesis (Entry Point)

Every DivinePL program must have a genesis function, which serves as the entry point. This is typically placed inside a Program class:

```javascript
bless Program {
  genesis() {
    // Program starts here
    revelation("Let there be code!");
    
    // Your main code here
    
    return salvation;
  }
}
```

### Miracles (Special Functions)

Miracles are special functions that perform extraordinary operations. They receive additional divine optimization and can transform data in miraculous ways:

```javascript
miracle healCorruptedData(data) {
  // Miracle functions can perform extraordinary operations
  data.restore();
  data.purify();
  return data;
}
```

### Prayers (Comments)

DivinePL supports two forms of prayers (comments):

1. Single-line prayers:
```javascript
üôè May this function calculate accurately üôè
```

2. Multi-line prayer blocks:
```javascript
üôè BEGIN PRAYER üôè
Lord of Code and Computation,
Bless this algorithm with efficiency,
Guide it to the correct output
üôè END PRAYER üôè
```

Regular comments also work:
```javascript
// This is a regular comment
```

### Covenants (Constants & Promises)

Covenants represent constants or promises in your code. They are declarations that should not be broken:

```javascript
// Constant declaration
covenant MAX_CONNECTIONS = 100;

// Promise-like covenant that establishes intent
covenant("This function shall handle all edge cases");
```

### Confessions (Error Handling)

DivinePL uses confessions instead of traditional try/catch for error handling:

```javascript
// Instead of try/catch
attempt_salvation {
  riskyOperation();
} forgive (error) {
  revelation("Error forgiven: " + error.message);
}

// For throwing errors
confess new Sin("Invalid input provided");
```

### Revelations (Logging)

Revelations are the divine way to log information:

```javascript
revelation("Processing complete!");
revelation(`User ${username} logged in successfully`);
```

### Prophecies (Future TODOs)

Prophecies mark areas of code that will need future attention:

```javascript
@prophesy("Will need optimization for large datasets")
bless processData(data) {
  // Current implementation
}
```

### Trinity Pattern (Module Structure)

The Trinity pattern is a recommended structure for larger DivinePL projects:

```
project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ holy_trinity/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ father.divine    // Creation & configuration
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ son.divine       // Implementation & business logic
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ holy_ghost.divine // Guidance, utilities & helpers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ genesis.divine       // Main entry point
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ commandments.config  // Configuration file
```

### Bible Verses (Inspirational Imports)

DivinePL allows importing biblical inspirations for different coding topics:

```javascript
import verse "wisdom";  // Imports wisdom-related inspiration
import verse "creation"; // Imports creation-related inspiration
import verse "light";   // Imports illumination concepts
```

## Command Line Interface

The DivinePL interpreter provides several divine commands:

### Run Command

Executes a DivinePL script with divine interpretation:

```bash
divine run path/to/script.divine [options]

Options:
  --verbose        Enable verbose output for debugging
  --revelation     Enable Revelation Mode for deep divine insight
  --override-sabbath  Force compilation on Sunday (requires --dev)
  --dev            Enable development mode (unlocks sinful operations)
```

### New Command

Creates a new DivinePL project with basic structure:

```bash
divine new project-name [options]

Options:
  --template <template>  Project template (default, miracle, or prophet)
```

### Confess Command

Checks if a DivinePL script is free from sin (linting):

```bash
divine confess path/to/script.divine
```

### Bible Command

Finds scriptural inspirations for your code:

```bash
divine bible <topic>

Examples:
  divine bible error    # Get inspiration about error handling
  divine bible loop     # Get inspiration about loops
```

### Prophesy Command

Prophesies future TODOs and potential bugs in your DivinePL script:

```bash
divine prophesy path/to/script.divine
```

### Miracle Command

Performs a miracle transformation on a secular code file:

```bash
divine miracle input.js output.divine
```

## Configuration

DivinePL projects use a `commandments.config` file for configuration:

```json
{
  "trinity": {
    "father": "main",
    "son": "child_processes",
    "holy_ghost": "background_services"
  },
  "sabbath_mode": true,
  "resurrection_enabled": true,
  "allow_confession": true,
  "miracles_enabled": true,
  "prophecy_enabled": true,
  "revelation_level": "deep",
  "divine_insights": {
    "enabled": true,
    "frequency": "medium"
  },
  "allowed_sins": [
    "console.log",
    "setTimeout"
  ],
  "forbidden_practices": [
    "eval",
    "with",
    "var",
    "goto"
  ],
  "blessing_requirements": {
    "functions": true,
    "classes": true,
    "modules": true
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Function Blessings

Always use the appropriate blessing for your functions:
- `bless` for regular functions
- `miracle` for extraordinary operations
- `genesis()` for program entry points

### 2. Righteous Variable Naming

- Use descriptive, virtuous names
- Avoid blasphemous variable names
- Use `let` instead of `var` (which is considered sinful)

### 3. Covenant Usage

- Use `covenant` for important constants
- Establish clear covenants for function expectations
- Never break a covenant once established

### 4. Trinity Pattern Implementation

Follow the Trinity pattern for larger projects:
- Father: Configuration, creation, and initialization
- Son: Core business logic and implementation
- Holy Ghost: Utilities, helpers, and guidance

### 5. Proper Error Confession

- Use `confess` instead of `throw` for errors
- Handle errors with forgiveness instead of catching
- Provide meaningful error messages for proper repentance

### 6. Sabbath Observance

- Respect the Sabbath day (Sunday) for code rest
- Use development mode only when absolutely necessary
- Plan your development schedule around the divine calendar

### 7. Documentation Through Revelation

- Use revelations to document code behavior
- Provide clear divine insights for future maintainers
- Explain miracles thoroughly so others can understand

## Examples

### Basic Calculator Example

```javascript
// divine_calculator.divine

import verse "wisdom";

üôè BEGIN PRAYER üôè
Lord of Mathematics,
Guide these calculations to accuracy and precision
üôè END PRAYER üôè

bless Program {
  genesis() {
    revelation("Divine Calculator Started");
    
    let num1 = 10;
    let num2 = 5;
    
    revelation(`Addition: ${this.add(num1, num2)}`);
    revelation(`Subtraction: ${this.subtract(num1, num2)}`);
    revelation(`Multiplication: ${this.multiply(num1, num2)}`);
    revelation(`Division: ${this.divide(num1, num2)}`);
    
    return salvation;
  }
  
  bless add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  }
  
  bless subtract(a, b) {
    return a - b;
  }
  
  miracle multiply(a, b) {
    // Multiplication is miraculous - it creates abundance from less
    return a * b;
  }
  
  bless divide(a, b) {
    // Check for division by zero
    if (b === 0) {
      confess new Sin("Division by zero is a mortal sin");
    }
    return a / b;
  }
}
```

### User Authentication Example

```javascript
// divine_auth.divine

import verse "wisdom";
import verse "security";

üôè Guide this authentication process to protect the righteous and block the wicked üôè

covenant SALT_ROUNDS = 10;
covenant MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS = 3;

bless Program {
  genesis() {
    let user = {
      username: "disciple12",
      password: "blessedP@ssw0rd"
    };
    
    // Authentication process
    if (this.authenticateUser(user)) {
      revelation("User authenticated successfully");
    } else {
      revelation("Authentication failed");
    }
    
    return salvation;
  }
  
  bless authenticateUser(user) {
    covenant("User credentials shall be protected");
    
    revelation("Validating user credentials");
    return this.validateCredentials(user.username, user.password);
  }
  
  miracle validateCredentials(username, password) {
    // Miraculous validation logic here
    revelation("Credentials validated through divine insight");
    return true;
  }
  
  @prophesy("Will need to add biometric authentication in future version")
  bless enhanceSecurity() {
    // Future security enhancements
  }
}
```

## Theological Framework & Design Philosophy

DivinePL draws upon religious metaphors to make programming concepts more tangible and memorable. These metaphors aren't meant to be literal theological statements but rather educational tools.

### Key Metaphorical Relationships:

1. **Functions as Blessings**: Functions give capabilities to your code, just as blessings bestow benefits.

2. **Errors as Sins**: Programming errors represent deviations from intended behavior, similar to how sin represents deviation from moral ideals.

3. **Comments as Prayers**: Both provide guidance and context, asking for assistance with particularly challenging code.

4. **Constants as Covenants**: Both represent unchanging agreements that provide stability and structure.

5. **Logging as Revelation**: Both share information and insights that would otherwise remain hidden.

6. **Code Organization as Trinity**: Represents the three aspects of well-structured code: creation (data), implementation (logic), and guidance (utilities).

7. **Program Execution as Creation**: The seven stages of program execution mirror the seven days of creation.

8. **Testing as Judgment**: Evaluating code quality is similar to spiritual discernment of good and bad.

### Philosophy

DivinePL is designed to encourage:

- **Clarity**: Code should be clear and understandable to others
- **Structure**: Programs should follow organized patterns
- **Ethics**: Code should be written with good intentions and avoid harmful practices
- **Community**: Knowledge should be shared in a respectful manner
- **Continuous Improvement**: Always strive to make your code better

DivinePL uses religious metaphors not to trivialize faith but to elevate programming practices by connecting them to familiar cultural concepts that emphasize care, responsibility, and structure.
